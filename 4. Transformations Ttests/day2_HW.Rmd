```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Make data for problem 1
library(FSAdata)
library(tidyr)
data("LobsterHI")
dat <- LobsterHI
dat <- dat[,c("day","legal","sublegal","berried")]
dat <- gather(dat, key=status, value=catch, legal, sublegal, berried)
write.csv(dat,"/home/brian/Documents/Workshops/Mexico fisheries/StatsClass/lobsterHI.csv",row.names=FALSE)

```


## Exercise 1
In a lobster fishery, you collect catch data according to 3 categories:

- sublegal (too small to keep)
- legal (big enough to keep)
- berried (female with eggs)

1. Read in the data from `lobsterHI.csv`
2. Make a boxplot of `catch` by category (`status`)
3. Decide which test to use to look for differences in catch by category (t-test or ANOVA).
4. Are the assumptions for your test ok?
5. Conduct the test.
6. What is your conclusion?

## Exercise 2
You sample fish in 2 time periods (1977-79 and 2001) and want to know if the fish are smaller or larger.

1. Read in the data from `BullTrout.csv`
2. Make a boxplot of `mass` by time period (`era`)
3. Decide which test to use to look for differences in `mass` by `era` (t-test or ANOVA).
4. Are the assumptions for your test ok?
5. Conduct the test.
6. What is your conclusion?
